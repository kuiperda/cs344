 i  : The GPS is implemented as a function
 ii : all of these objects are strings or lists of strings
 iii: Yes, it is recursive: 'GPS' calls 'achieve_all' calls 'achieve' calls 'apply_operator' calls 'achieve_all' again

d
 i  : Monkey and Banana problem: Monkey wants to get bananas but has to perform a certain sequence of actions 
	in the correct order to be able to get them. The code does implement these actions faithfully.
 ii : The GPS seems to rely on the input from monkeys.py to know what actions it is able to take, but it finds a logical
	path from the initial state to the desired end state based on its available options. More particularly, it
	works backwards from the end state via the precondition actions.
 iii: The code is artificially intelligent, it acts in a rational manner (maybe not so much a human manner)
 iv : Yes, that monkey would be showing intelligence
